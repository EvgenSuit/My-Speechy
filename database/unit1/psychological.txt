Introduction
Try to lift up your shoulders and tighten your stomach and lips. Is this feeling familiar to you?
If yes, you could have stuttering. And it's not uncommon. Over 80 million people all over the world have it. And this number accounts for only registered cases. So you're not alone! The creator of My Speechy has had stuttering for most of his life. He decided to create the app so that he could help others and himself.

There can be a ton of reasons why a person stutters, someone could've scared or hurt them. But some people have no clue of where their stuttering came from, including me. And that's okay. It's still a part of you. And it doesn't mean that stuttering can't be cured. It's all about perseverance.
Stuttering can be described as a feeling of being stuck, insertain. When that block hits you, it feels like the end of the world, and you just don't know what to do.
There exists an analogy that for a stutterer approaching a person to talk to is like climbing towards a goal and then seeing a threat. So when you make a decision either to approach or not, you can either slow down and buy some time untill a miracle happens, quickly push through, or escape the situation. A conflict appears. A person who chooses the first option will have to confront another person and actually try to say what they want. But the fear of stutter, previous negative experiences, and the tension resulted from "buying time" only reinforces the block. Most of the people who stutter choose the avoidant path, it just feels intuitive and safe.
So the the presense of inner conflict that appears withing a person's body plays a big role in their day-to-day life.
Another analogy to stutter is the flow of brain waves that contain the information we want to convey. They just flow and flow... And at a certain point they all stop. So does the proper functioning of face mustles, breathing, thinking. And for some reason our eyes start closing or randomly blinking.
